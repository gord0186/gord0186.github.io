					This is a package design was an eco friendly package for the company <em>Mad Catz Cyborg</em> Mouse the <em>R.A.T.7.</em> For the package I keep it clean and simple. And to make it eco friendly I made it all out of recycled paper. I also designed the package so that it folded together so there was no glue.

            <h2>About</h2>
            
            <p class="unit unit-s-1">My name is Rudy Gordon; I come from a small rural area out side of Ottawa. I went to school at Opeongo High school, when I attended school there I was not to sure what I wanted to do with my life; but when one of my family members approached me and wanted me to make a crest to represent my grandpa. I did it, but when I was done and seen the final product on the jacket I new that this is what I wanted to do. To do all of that work and see the peace done and out there in the world gave me a feeling of accomplishment. From there on I have just tried making my skills better in every thing that I have done.</p>
    
            <p class="unit unit-s-1">Now that I am a Third year graphic designer I can do far better thing then I every thought that I could do; and still get the same kind of enjoyment out of them because there is no limits to what we can do. There is a quote that I heard that I found it suit's the way that i think it is by <em>Les Brown</em> and he said <em>“The only limits to the possibilities in your life tomorrow are the buts you use today.”</em>
